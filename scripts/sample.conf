# If we don't see any events for $SETTLE_DURATION time, assume that it's safe to run the command. Format is HH:MM:SS,
# with HH and MM optional.
SETTLE_DURATION=5

# However, if we see a stream of changes for longer than $MAX_WAIT_TIME with no break of $SETTLE_DURATION or more, then
# go ahead and run the command. Otherwise we might be waiting forever for the directory to stop changing. Format is
# HH:MM:SS, with HH and MM optional.
MAX_WAIT_TIME=05:00

# After running the command, wait at least this long before running it again, even if $SETTLE_DURATION time has passed
# after change. This controls the maximum frequency of the command.
MIN_PERIOD=6:00

# This is the command to run when a change is detected. If this command runs quickly and triggers some other
# long-running task, you want to be sure that rerunning this command while the long-running task is in progress won't
# cause any problems. You can also allow this command to wait until the work is done, which will cause it to naturally
# limit its run frequency. (But you might still want to set a longer MIN_PERIOD above in order to prevent back-to-back
# execution.)

COMMAND="/bin/bash /scripts/ENCODEREND ${watch_src_path}"

# Set the user and group ID that you want to run the command as, as well as the umask. The user will be randomly

# This is a very good idea if your command modifies the WATCH_DIR in any way. You can easily trigger yourself because
# most programs don't worry about checking the current state before making a change. e.g. chmod will set the mode of a
# file even if it already has that mode.

# Set to true to use polling to detect changes. For non-linux file systems, such as Windows shares, you must use polling.
